    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow is a very important process to hydrology. It has broad ecological implications and thus impacts human livelihoods, particularly in and around high latitude and mountainous systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important phases of the hydrologic cycle within these regions, the annual melting of accumulated winter snowfall provides the dominant source of water for streamflow and groundwater recharge for approximately one sixth of the global population\n",
    "\n",
    "The anticipated warmer temperatures will alter the type and onset of precipitation; multiple regions, including the Rocky Mountains of North America have already measured a reduction in snowpack volume and warmer temperatures have shifted precipitation from snowfall to rain, causing snowmelt to occur earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial calculates the first day of no snow annually at the pixel level, providing the user with the ability to track the seasonal and interannual variability in the timing of snowmelt toward a better understanding of how the hydrological cycles of higher latitude and mountainous regions are responding to climate change.\n",

For this quesitons, apply a Sen's Slope reducer (i.e. `ee.Reducer.sensSlope()`) to calculate the annual trend and display the trend (i.e. slope band) on a map. All of the bands required should be calculated for the images. Note: This exercise is about implementing the trend analysis. Goodness of fit is not measured here, nor is significance considered. Inter-annual variability can be influence the slope too."
